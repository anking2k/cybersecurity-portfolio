# Cybersecurity Portfolio

## About Me

Hello! I'm Andre' King, a cybersecurity enthusiast with a passion for problem solving and digital defense. My interest in cybersecurity began like a lot of others... when I saw Mr. Robot! There were so many fascinating scenarios that seemed "doable" and it really sparked something inside of me. Since then, I've been dedicating time to hands-on learning, exploring a wide range of topics including network security, web exploitation, cryptography, and incident response.

## Recent CTF Experience

I recently participated in the National Cyber League Fall 2025 event, where I had the chance to test my skills against real-world problems. It was an exciting, challenging, and rewarding experience that gave me practical exposure to:

- Reconnaissance and open source intelligence (OSINT)
- Web vulnerability discovery and exploitation
- Password cracking and cryptography challenges
- Network and packet analysis
- Digital forensics and incident investigation

## Highlights

- **Team Collaboration:** Worked with a talented team to solve multi-stage challenges, communicate findings, and share strategies. We all learned and scored much higher than any of us thought (2810/3000).
- **Personal Growth:** Improved my speed and accuracy at flag discovery, and learned how to efficiently document my methodologies—skills I'm carrying forward into future events and studies.
- **Achievement:** Ranked 7/110 among SANS teams and 32/4214 overall (Standard Bracket - Team Game)

## What’s Next

I’m actively learning and preparing for the next CTF, expanding into areas like pentesting and cloud security. This portfolio will serve as my ongoing journal for new write-ups, reflections, and cybersecurity projects.
